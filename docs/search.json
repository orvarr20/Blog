    "text": "Introduction\nThe data set is from the National UFO reporting center and includes many different variables about UFO sightings, from the location of the sighting to the shape of the UFO to whether or not there was an image. This data was retrieved from the tidyTuesday github from this link: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-06-20/readme.md. There are 96429 different observations in the data set, and this analysis is going to focus on the variables reported_date_time, state, and day_part. The question for this analysis is what year, part of day, and state is most common among the reported UFO sightings.\nPrimary Visualizations:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nufo_sightings &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-06-20/ufo_sightings.csv')\n\nufo_df &lt;- ufo_sightings |&gt; filter(country_code == \"US\") |&gt; \n  select(1, 5,9,12)\n\nufo_df &lt;- ufo_df |&gt; separate(col = reported_date_time, sep = \" \", into = c(\"date\", \"time\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(date = ymd(date))\nggplot(data = ufo_df, aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_histogram(colour = \"black\", fill = \"white\", bins = 35) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, we can see that the number of UFO sightings dramatically increased during the early 2000s. We also see a peak in the number of sightings around 2016/2017.\n\nufo_day_part &lt;- ufo_df |&gt; group_by(day_part) |&gt; \n  summarise(count = n()) |&gt; \n  filter(day_part != \"NA\") |&gt;\n  mutate(day_part = fct_reorder(day_part, count))\nggplot(ufo_day_part, aes(x = day_part, y = count)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFrom this bar plot, we see that night is by far the most common time for UFOs to be sighted, with dawn (astronomial, nautical, and civil) being the least common times.\n\nufo_state &lt;- ufo_df |&gt; mutate(state = fct_recode(state, FL = \"Fl\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(state) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n()) |&gt;\n  mutate(state = fct_reorder(state, count))\nggplot(ufo_state, aes(x = state, y = count)) +\n  geom_col() + \n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 7))\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot we can see that California is the most common place where UFOs are sighted, having over 11,000 recorded sightings since 1925,followed by Florida. Washington DC has the least amount of sightings with less than 100.\nConclusion and Wrap-Up\nIn recent years, UFO sightings have been more common, particularly around the year 2016/2017. The night is the most common time among the UFO sightings and California is the state with the most amount of sightings. In the future, it would be interesting to look at each sighting to see if there are multiple reports for the same sighting by different people, rather than just looking at which years, places, and times were more common overall.\nConnection to Class Ideas\nThese visualizations connect to class as they are strategically chosen to show as much about the data as possible. For example, the histogram was chosen for date as it shows the center, spread, shape, and approximately the sample size, which another plot, such as a density plot, would not have shown all of these attributes of the data. Similarly, a bar plot was chosen so that the sample size and distribution could easily be seen. Additionally, the bar plots were arranged in descending order so that the audience could compare the values easier. Lastly, the theme needed to be adjusted for the state bar plot, as the names of the states were overlapping on the y axis. All of these choices relate to what we have been talking about in class on how to make the visualizations easy for the reader to see and interpret the data properly."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe data set is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau about women in the workforce. The data was retrieved from the tidyTuesday github from the following link: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-03-05. There are 2088 observations in the data set, 522 for each year from 2013 to 2016, and 12 variables. The variables that are of interest for this analysis are the year, wage_percent_of_male, major_category, and percent_female. This analysis will focus on what major categories have the highest female percentage and how the average female wage percentage of their male counterparts has changed. This analysis will also create a linear model that can be used to predict the wage_percent_of_male based on the year.\nPrimary Visualizations\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\njobs_gender &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-03-05/jobs_gender.csv\")\n\nRows: 2088 Columns: 12\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): occupation, major_category, minor_category\ndbl (9): year, total_workers, workers_male, workers_female, percent_female, ...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\npercent_data &lt;- jobs_gender |&gt; select(year, major_category, percent_female) |&gt;\n  group_by(major_category) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean = mean(percent_female),\n            sd = sd(percent_female),\n            n_observations = n()) |&gt;\n  mutate(se = sd / sqrt(n_observations),\n         lb_se = mean - se,\n         ub_se = mean + se) |&gt;\n  mutate(major_category = fct_reorder(.f = major_category, .x = mean))\n\nggplot(data = percent_data, aes(x = major_category, y = mean)) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lb_se, ymax = ub_se)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6)) +\n  labs(y = \"Mean\", x = \"Major Category\")\n\n\n\n\nFrom this graph, we see that healthcare practitioners and sales/office have the highest percent of female workers at around 65% and 59% respectively.

From the corresponding table of coefficients, we see that for every year increase the model predicts that the wage percent of male goes up by 0.201.\nConclusion and Wrap-Up\nThe major category of healthcare practitioners had the highest percent of female workers while natural resources, construction, and maintenance had the lowest percentage of female workers. The wage percent of male increased from 2013 to 2016 and the model predicted that for every year the predicted wage percent of male goes up by 0.201. In the future, it would be interesting to include more predictors in the model, to see how other factors influence the predicted wage percent of male.\nConnection to Class Ideas\nThe first two visualizations connect to class because of the inclusion of errorbars. In chapter 7 we discussed the importance of showing variability in the visualizations and how to include error bars in plots. These ideas were implemented when creating the plots to answer the first two questions. Additionally, the model connects to class since chapter 8 was reviewing concepts from STAT 213, focusing on how to interpret the coefficients and how to make these plots in R. The 4 step strategy from chapter 8 was implemented to visualize the model predictions."

Similarly, we see that for a bean origin of Asia, North America, and Oceania the predicted rating is expected to be less than the reference (Africa) assuming the cocoa percentage and company continent remains the same. However, for a South America bean origin, the predicted rating is expected to be 0.00518 higher than Africa for the same cocoa_percent and company continent. Finally, we see that for a company continent of Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, or Sourth America the predicted rating is expected to be higher than the reference (Africa) if the cocoa percentage and bean origin remain constant. For example, for a European company, the rating is predicted to be 0.211 higher than an African company for the same cocoa percentage and the same bean origin continent. All of these observations would be easier to see in a visualization. So, let’s visualize this data.\n\nlibrary(modelr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'modelr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:broom':\n\n    bootstrap\n\ngrid &lt;- chocolate_data |&gt;\n  data_grid(\n    cocoa_percent = seq_range(cocoa_percent, n = 6),\n    company_continent = chocolate_data |&gt; pull(company_continent) |&gt; levels(),\n    bean_continent = chocolate_data |&gt; pull(bean_continent) |&gt; levels()\n  )\ngrid\n\n# A tibble: 180 × 3\n   cocoa_percent company_continent bean_continent\n           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;         \n 1            42 Africa            Africa        \n 2            42 Africa            Asia          \n 3            42 Africa            North America \n 4            42 Africa            Oceania       \n 5            42 Africa            South America \n 6            42 Asia              Africa        \n 7            42 Asia              Asia          \n 8            42 Asia              North America \n 9            42 Asia              Oceania       \n10            42 Asia              South America \n# ℹ 170 more rows\n\naug &lt;- augment(model, newdata = grid, interval = \"confidence\")\naug\n\n# A tibble: 180 × 6\n   cocoa_percent company_continent bean_continent .fitted .lower .upper\n           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1            42 Africa            Africa            3.35   3.16   3.54\n 2            42 Africa            Asia              3.34   3.13   3.54\n 3            42 Africa            North America     3.34   3.15   3.54\n 4            42 Africa            Oceania           3.33   3.12   3.55\n 5            42 Africa            South America     3.36   3.16   3.56\n 6            42 Asia              Africa            3.52   3.39   3.65\n 7            42 Asia              Asia              3.51   3.38   3.63\n 8            42 Asia              North America     3.51   3.38   3.64\n 9            42 Asia              Oceania           3.50   3.34   3.66\n10            42 Asia              South America     3.52   3.40   3.65\n# ℹ 170 more rows\n\nggplot(data = chocolate_data, aes(x = cocoa_percent, y = rating)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_line(data = aug, aes(y = .fitted, colour = company_continent)) +\n  facet_wrap(~bean_continent) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(y = \"Predicted Rating\", x = \"Cocoa Percent\") +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d()\n\n\n\n\nFrom this visualization, we can see that for all of the company continents, the predicted rating decreases for higher cocoa percents. We can also see that African companies seem to have a lower predicted rating whereas Oceania companies seem to have a higher rating. However, we can also see that this might not be the best model as the relationship, meaning the slope, between cocoa percent and rating does not change depending on the company continent. We can fix this by incorporating an interaction between variables.\n\nmodel2 &lt;- lm(rating ~ cocoa_percent + bean_continent + cocoa_percent:bean_continent + company_continent, data = chocolate_data)\nmodel2 |&gt; tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 5\n   term                                    estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 (Intercept)                              3.96e+0   0.349     11.4    3.98e-29\n 2 cocoa_percent                           -1.31e-2   0.00471   -2.78   5.55e- 3\n 3 bean_continentAsia                      -3.48e-1   0.652     -0.534  5.94e- 1\n 4 bean_continentNorth America             -3.15e-1   0.410     -0.769  4.42e- 1\n 5 bean_continentOceania                   -7.31e-1   0.645     -1.13   2.57e- 1\n 6 bean_continentSouth America             -9.78e-3   0.375     -0.0261 9.79e- 1\n 7 company_continentAsia                    1.67e-1   0.0954     1.75   8.09e- 2\n 8 company_continentEurope                  2.11e-1   0.0867     2.43   1.52e- 2\n 9 company_continentNorth America           1.85e-1   0.0861     2.15   3.16e- 2\n10 company_continentOceania                 2.66e-1   0.0998     2.66   7.81e- 3\n11 company_continentSouth America           1.04e-1   0.0926     1.13   2.60e- 1\n12 cocoa_percent:bean_continentAsia         4.68e-3   0.00911    0.514  6.07e- 1\n13 cocoa_percent:bean_continentNorth Amer…  4.29e-3   0.00573    0.749  4.54e- 1\n14 cocoa_percent:bean_continentOceania      9.99e-3   0.00902    1.11   2.68e- 1\n15 cocoa_percent:bean_continentSouth Amer…  2.25e-4   0.00524    0.0430 9.66e- 1\n\naug2 &lt;- augment(model2, newdata = grid, interval = \"confidence\")\naug2\n\n# A tibble: 180 × 6\n   cocoa_percent company_continent bean_continent .fitted .lower .upper\n           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1            42 Africa            Africa            3.41   3.09   3.73\n 2            42 Africa            Asia              3.26   2.77   3.74\n 3            42 Africa            North America     3.27   3.02   3.53\n 4            42 Africa            Oceania           3.10   2.62   3.58\n 5            42 Africa            South America     3.41   3.19   3.63\n 6            42 Asia              Africa            3.58   3.29   3.86\n 7            42 Asia              Asia              3.43   2.97   3.88\n 8            42 Asia              North America     3.44   3.23   3.65\n 9            42 Asia              Oceania           3.27   2.81   3.72\n10            42 Asia              South America     3.58   3.42   3.74\n# ℹ 170 more rows\n\nggplot(data = chocolate_data, aes(x = cocoa_percent, y = rating)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_line(data = aug2, aes(y = .fitted, colour = company_continent)) +\n  facet_wrap(~bean_continent) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d() +\n  labs(y = \"Predicted Rating\", x = \"Cocoa Percent\")\n\n\n\n\nFrom this visualization we can see that if the bean continent is Africa or South America, there is a steeper slope in the decrease in rating as the cocoa percent increases, whereas Oceania does not have too much of a decrease with an increase in cocoa percentage.\nConclusion and Wrap-Up\nFrom this analysis found that the as the cocoa percentage increased, the predicted rating decreased, with African companies having lower ratings and Oceania companies having higher ratings. Additionally, there was a steeper decrease for African and South American bean origins and a more level trend for Oceania bean origins. In the future, it would be interesting to see the trend of individual countries within the continents, as this is the data that was originally provided and it would allow us to see more specifically which countries have the best retention of rating with an increase in cocoa percentage.\nConnection to Class Ideas\nThese visualizations relate to class because of the use of linear models. We have spent a lot of time in class using the model, grid, augment, visualize method to create data visualizations for models. These visualizations makes it easier to see the trends in predicted values, especially if the target audience is someone without a statistical background."
